# Enhanced Image-Colour-Transfer
============================================================

##### An Enhanced Implementation of the Colour Transfer Method proposed by E Reinhard et al.

A revised version of the existing method is proposed which utilises image representation in the L\*a\*b colour space.  As with previous implementations, the method takes account of the mean and standard deviation values of the respective L\*a\*b components but, in addition, it addresses the correlation between the 'a' and 'b' colour components.  This method is described further in the file '[Enhanced Image-Colour-Transfer.pdf](Documents/Enhanced%20Image-Colour-Transfer.pdf)' in the Documents folder.

Additional options allow for:- the rescaling of data to constrain it within range; recursive iteration of the transfer process, and a choice of shading method.

The examples below were generated by an informal adaptation of an existing Python implementation.  In due course, code will be posted here for a C++ implementation using OpenCV.

These examples here have been selected to illustrate the differences between the different processing methods.  For other image combinations, the differences may be less noticeable.
#  
#  
*The images below are as follows: - target image, source image, image after basic processing and image after enhanced processing.   For basic processing, there is a single iteration with data clipping, no cross correlation processing and source-image-derived shading.   For enhanced processing, there are two iterations, with data scaling, cross correlation processing and target-image-derived shading.*

*The images below are as follows:- image after enhanced processing, image after processing by a well-known commercial software application, image after processing by a new proprietary method developed by the author, image after processing by an on line facility which uses a neural algorithm of artistic style.*
